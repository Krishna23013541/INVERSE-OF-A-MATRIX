# INVERSE-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the inverse of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
## Step1 : 
import numpy as np
## Step 2: 
We have created a matrix using array and we will find inverse of this.
## Step 3: 
We can find the inverse of the martix by using np.linalg.inv and passing the matrix.
## Step 4: 
Finally, print the value of the inverse of the matrix.
## Program:
Program to find the inverse of a matrix.

import numpy as np
A=np.array([[2,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,-1,2]])
inverse=np.linalg.inv(A)
print(inverse)

```
## Output:
